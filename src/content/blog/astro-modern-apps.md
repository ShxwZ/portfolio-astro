# Building Modern Web Apps with Astro

Astro has revolutionized how we think about building websites. In this post, I'll share my experience building modern web applications with this amazing framework.

## Why Choose Astro?

After working with various frameworks, Astro stands out for several reasons:

- **Zero JavaScript by default**: Ships only the JS you actually need
- **Island Architecture**: Components are isolated and load independently  
- **Framework agnostic**: Use React, Vue, Svelte, or pure HTML/CSS
- **Built-in optimizations**: Image optimization, CSS bundling, and more

## Key Features I Love

### 1. Content Collections
```typescript
import { getCollection } from 'astro:content';

// Type-safe content with validation
const posts = await getCollection('blog');
```

### 2. Partial Hydration
```astro
---
// This component only hydrates when needed
---
<InteractiveWidget client:load />
<StaticContent />
```

### 3. Built-in Internationalization
Perfect for multilingual sites like this portfolio!
